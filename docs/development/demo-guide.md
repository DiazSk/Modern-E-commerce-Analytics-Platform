## ⏱️ 5-MINUTE DEMO SCRIPT (TIMED)

### [0:00-0:30] Opening Hook (30 seconds)

**Script:**
"I built a modern e-commerce analytics platform as a 6-week portfolio project demonstrating production-grade data engineering skills.

The platform processes $692,000 in annual revenue across 5,000 orders from 1,000 customers, with real-time clickstream tracking of 50,000 events.

The architecture spans the full data stack - from AWS infrastructure and Airflow orchestration, through dbt dimensional modeling and Great Expectations quality gates, to Metabase business intelligence dashboards.

Let me show you the BI layer, where data becomes decisions."

**Practice Notes:**
- Speak clearly and confidently
- Make eye contact (if video interview)
- Smile when saying "Let me show you"
- Pause after "where data becomes decisions"

**Key Numbers to Memorize:**
- $692,000 revenue
- 5,000 orders
- 1,000 customers
- 50,000 events
- 6-week timeline

---

### [0:30-2:00] Executive Dashboard (90 seconds)

**Script:**
"First, the Executive Dashboard gives leadership immediate visibility into business health.

[POINT TO METRICS ROW]
We're tracking $692,000 in total revenue, with $30,000 generated last month showing 17% month-over-month growth. The average order value is $138, and we have 126 active customers in the last 30 days - these are the pulse metrics executives check daily.

[POINT TO REVENUE TREND CHART]
This 12-month revenue trend is particularly interesting. You can see healthy business growth from $24,000 to $33,000 monthly. There's seasonal variation with a peak in March at $33,200, which might correlate with spring fashion launches.

[POINT TO CATEGORIES BAR CHART]
The category breakdown is a strategic insight. Women's clothing generates $24,000 - that's 35% of revenue from one category. Electronics follows at $22,000. This tells the product team where to focus inventory investment and marketing spend.

The key business value here is reducing reporting time from hours to real-time. Instead of waiting for weekly Excel reports, leadership can see current business health instantly and make data-driven decisions."

**Gestures:**
- Point to each metric as you mention it
- Trace the trend line with finger/cursor
- Show enthusiasm when mentioning "real-time"

**Pause Points:**
- After "$30,000... 17% growth" (let it sink in)
- After trend explanation (check if they're following)
- After "real-time" (emphasize the impact)

---

### [2:00-3:30] Product Performance Dashboard (90 seconds)

**Script:**
"The Product Performance dashboard combines multiple analytical techniques for inventory optimization.

[POINT TO HORIZONTAL BAR CHART]
This shows our top 10 revenue generators. The Samsung 49-inch curved gaming monitor dominates at $6,367 in total sales - clearly a star product.

[POINT TO MULTI-METRIC BARS]
The category performance uses grouped bars to compare four metrics simultaneously - order count, units sold, revenue, and average item value. Women's clothing shows highest volume, while electronics has the highest average value at around $75 per item. This indicates electronics is our premium category with lower volume but higher margins.

[POINT TO SCATTER PLOT]
This bubble chart correlates product ratings with sales. Each bubble's size represents revenue. We're looking for patterns - high rating but low sales means marketing opportunity, while low rating with high sales suggests a quality issue we need to address.

[POINT TO COLOR-CODED INVENTORY]
This is my favorite - the color-coded slow-inventory analysis. The red critical status immediately flags products needing action. The WD 4TB gaming drive has only 52 units sold at a $114 price point. The men's cotton jacket has 59 units.

This visualization identified $3,450 in slow-moving inventory. Our action plan: 30% discount on the gaming drive from $114 to $79.80, and bundle the jacket with our best-selling t-shirts. This prevents dead inventory and recovers warehouse space for better performers."

**Emphasis Points:**
- "Multiple analytical techniques" (shows sophistication)
- "Four metrics simultaneously" (technical capability)
- "This is my favorite" (show personality)
- "$3,450 in slow-moving inventory" (quantify impact)

---

### [3:30-5:00] Customer Analytics Dashboard (90 seconds - Final Impact)

**Script:**
"The Customer Analytics dashboard reveals our biggest business opportunity through segmentation.

[POINT TO DONUT CHART - SEGMENTS]
This segmentation shows 75% of our 1,000 customers are classified as low-value, spending under $500 lifetime. That's 754 customers representing a massive upselling opportunity. If we can upgrade even 10% from low to medium value through targeted email campaigns or loyalty rewards, that's $50,000 in additional annual revenue.

On the flip side, our VIP and high-value segments - just 2.1% and 18.5% respectively - these top 206 customers likely drive 60 to 70% of total revenue based on Pareto principle. These are the customers we protect with white-glove treatment.

[POINT TO TOP CUSTOMERS TABLE]
The top customer, Kelsey Walton, has spent over $14,000 across 28 orders. The top 20 customers represent 15-20% of total revenue. They need dedicated account management, exclusive early access to new products, and VIP perks.

[POINT TO ORDER FREQUENCY CHART]
This frequency distribution shows 19.7% of customers are super loyal with 10 or more orders - nearly 200 customers. These are our retention sweet spot.

Interestingly, 29.6% made only one purchase, and 22.3% registered but never ordered. Each group needs different engagement strategies: loyalty programs for the frequent buyers, re-activation campaigns with comeback discounts for dormant users, and post-purchase nurturing for one-time buyers to get that critical second order."

**Strong Closing:**
"So in summary - three dashboards, 16 visualizations, and over $53,000 in identified business opportunities. All dashboards auto-refresh every 5-15 minutes, and I optimized query performance by 67% through strategic indexing.

The platform is production-ready, fully tested with 96% data quality success rate, and handles 50,000 events daily. Thank you - I'm happy to dive deeper into any component."

**Final Impression:**
- Confident tone on closing numbers
- Pause before "Thank you"
- Smile and make eye contact
- Open posture for questions

## 🎯 PRACTICE SCHEDULE

### Session 1: Script Familiarization (30 minutes)

**Goal:** Memorize key points, not word-for-word

**Activity:**
1. Read script aloud 3 times
2. Note which parts feel awkward
3. Adjust wording to your natural speech
4. Write key bullet points on index card:
   ```
   Opening: $692k, 5k orders, 1k customers, 6 weeks
   Executive: $30k MoM +17%, $138 AOV, 126 active
   Product: Samsung $6k, $3,450 slow inventory, 30% discount
   Customer: 75% low-value = $50k opportunity, Kelsey $14k
   Close: $53k total, 67% faster, 96% quality
   ```

---

### Session 2: Timed Run-Through (30 minutes)

**Goal:** Hit 5-minute target (±30 seconds)

**Activity:**
1. Set timer for 5 minutes
2. Stand up (better energy)
3. Deliver full script
4. Note time when finished
5. Identify sections to speed up/slow down
6. Repeat 2-3 times until timing perfect

**Common Timing Issues:**
- Too fast: <4:30 (add details, pause more)
- Too slow: >5:30 (trim examples, speak faster)
- Sweet spot: 4:45-5:15

---

### Session 3: Gestures & Visuals (30 minutes)

**Goal:** Smooth pointing and screen sharing

**Activity:**
1. Practice with actual dashboards open
2. Point to specific metrics as you mention them
3. Smooth transitions between dashboards
4. Practice "Let me show you..." transitions
5. Record yourself (phone/webcam)
6. Watch back and critique

**Visual Flow:**
```
Opening → Executive (metrics) → Executive (trend) →
Executive (categories) → Product (top 10) → Product (multi-metric) →
Product (scatter) → Product (slow inventory - PAUSE HERE!) →
Customer (segments - PAUSE HERE!) → Customer (top table) →
Customer (frequency) → Close strong!
```

**Pause Points (Let Impact Sink In):**
- After "$3,450 in slow-moving inventory"
- After "75% are low-value... $50,000 opportunity"
- Before closing "Thank you"

---

### Session 4: Q&A Preparation (45 minutes)

**Goal:** Smooth pivot from demo to questions

**Practice Questions:**

**Q: "How long did this take?"**
A: "Six weeks total, with Week 6 focused on the dashboards you just saw. The systematic week-by-week approach demonstrates I can scope, plan, and execute complex projects incrementally."

**Q: "What was hardest part?"**
A: "Most interesting was Metabase's SQL parser limitation with aliases in GROUP BY. I solved it through Common Table Expressions - an architectural solution rather than a patch. It improved code readability too."

**Q: "How would you scale this?"**
A: "For 10x growth, I'd partition the orders table by month, add pre-aggregated tables for common dashboards, and switch to Snowflake for separate compute-storage scaling. For 100x, we'd need Spark for event processing and a caching layer."

**Q: "Show me the SQL for customer segmentation."**
[OPEN METABASE ULTIMATE GUIDE → Navigate to query → Show and explain CTE pattern]

**Practice:** Answer each in 30-60 seconds, then expand if they seem interested!

---

### Session 5: Mock Interview (60 minutes)

**Goal:** Full interview simulation

**Setup:**
1. Ask friend/mentor to interview you
2. Give them question list (below)
3. Do full 5-min demo
4. Answer their questions for 10-15 min
5. Get feedback
6. Iterate and improve

**Mock Interviewer Questions:**
1. Walk me through your project

## 🎯 COMMON DEMO MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ❌ Don't Do This:

1. **Reading from script** - Sounds robotic
   - ✅ Instead: Know key points, speak naturally

2. **Apologizing for anything** - "Sorry this is just a toy project"
   - ✅ Instead: Confident: "This demonstrates production skills"

3. **Going into weeds too early** - "Let me explain every JOIN..."
   - ✅ Instead: Start high-level, dive deep only if asked

4. **Rambling without structure** - Jump between topics
   - ✅ Instead: Clear sections (Opening → Exec → Product → Customer → Close)

5. **Forgetting numbers** - "Um, revenue was like... a lot"
   - ✅ Instead: Key numbers memorized ($692k, $53k, 67%, 96.3%)

6. **Monotone delivery** - Boring and unengaged
   - ✅ Instead: Vary tone, show enthusiasm on impact points

7. **Not showing visuals** - Just talking, no screen share
   - ✅ Instead: Show dashboards, point to specific metrics

8. **Rushing through close** - Weak ending
   - ✅ Instead: Strong summary, pause, confident thank you
